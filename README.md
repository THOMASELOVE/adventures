### Defining Data Science

- The Venn Diagram of Data Science I used comes from [TowardsDataScience.com](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-statistics-e9d72d818745)
- The Venn Diagram version 2.0 that I presented is Copyright (c) 2014 by Steven Geringer, Raleigh, NC.
- The description of the elements of Data Science comes from Grolemund and Wickham's [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
- The FacePalm cartoon came to me [from this link](https://whatsthebigdata.com/2015/10/17/how-to-become-a-unicorn-data-scientist-and-make-more-than-240000/) at whatsthebigdata.com, but was originally published in *Forbes*.
- This set of comments by Rafael Irizarry on the [Draft NIH Strategic Plan for Data Science](https://simplystatistics.org/2018/04/02/input-on-the-draft-nih-strategic-plan-for-data-science/) was illuminating for me.
